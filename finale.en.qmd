## Greg {#sec-finale-Greg}

When I started volunteering at the University of Toronto, some of my students asked me why I would teach for free. This was my answer:

> When I was your age, I thought universities existed to teach people how to learn. Later, in grad school, I thought universities were about doing research and creating new knowledge. Now that I’m in my forties, though, I’ve realized that what we’re really teaching you is how to take over the world, because you’re going to have to whether you want to or not.
>
> My parents are in their seventies. They don’t run the world any more; it’s people my age who pass laws and make life-and-death decisions in hospitals. As scary as it is, we are the grownups.
>
> Twenty years from now, we’ll be heading for retirement and you will be in charge. That may sound like a long time when you’re nineteen, but take three breaths and it’s gone. That’s why we give you problems whose answers can’t be cribbed from last year’s notes. That’s why we put you in situations where you have to figure out what needs to be done right now, what can be left for later, and what you can simply ignore. It’s because if you don’t learn how to do these things now, you won’t be ready to do them when you have to.

It was all true, but it wasn’t the whole story. I don’t want people to make the world a better place so that I can retire in comfort. I want them to do it because it’s the greatest adventure of our time. A hundred and fifty years ago, most societies practiced slavery. A hundred years ago, [my grandmother wasn’t legally a person in Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Famous_Five_(Canada)). In the year I was born, most of the world’s people suffered under totalitarian rule, and judges were still ordering electroshock therapy to “cure” homosexuals. There’s still a lot wrong with the world, but look at how many more choices we have than our grandparents did. Look at how many more things we can know, and be, and enjoy because we’re finally taking the Golden Rule seriously.

I am less optimistic today than I was then. Climate change, mass extinction, surveillance capitalism, inequality on a scale we haven’t seen in a century, the re-emergence of racist nationalism: my generation has watched it all happen and shrugged. The bill for our cowardice, lethargy, and greed won’t come due until my daughter is grown, but it will come, and by the time it does there will be no easy solutions to these problems (and possibly no solutions at all).

So this is why I teach today: I’m angry. I’m angry because your sex and your color and your parents’ wealth and connections shouldn’t count for more than how smart or honest or hard-working you are. I’m angry because we turned the internet into a cesspool. I’m angry because Nazis are on the march once again and billionaires are playing with rocket ships while the planet is melting. I’m angry, so I teach, because the world only gets better when we teach people how to make it better.

In his 1947 essay “Why I Write”, George Orwell wrote:

> In a peaceful age I might have written ornate or merely descriptive books, and might have remained almost unaware of my political loyalties. As it is I have been forced into becoming a sort of pamphleteer… Every line of serious work that I have written since 1936 has been written, directly or indirectly, against totalitarianism… It seems to me nonsense, in a period like our own, to think that one can avoid writing of such subjects. Everyone writes of them in one guise or another. It is simply a question of which side one takes.

Replace “writing” with “teaching” and you’ll have the reason I do what I do.

Thank you for reading—I hope we can teach together some day. Until then:

Why I teach it is intimately linked to my personal history…

I was born in Juan José Paso, a small town in rural Argentina. When I was six, my elementary school bought the only computer in the entire town. The principal gave a lesson about computers, and the moment I saw it, it was love at first sight. The school held an exam, and the student with the highest score would have one computer class and two craft classes (sewing and knitting for girls) instead of the usual three. I was one of those students.

A few years later, we moved to another town after a flood devastated our home. This new place was close to a city where I could study programming. From ages 9 to 14, my parents drove 80 kilometers every Saturday to take me to class. We didn’t have a car, and there was no public transport in the rural area, but since my dad is a mechanic, his clients would lend him their cars for the trip.

At 15, I started my first job teaching informatics. Since then, I have never stopped teaching and learning about coding. I taught children, teenagers, and adults. I have trained teachers in computing skills and to use the computer to teach since 1997. My high school science fair project, “The Computer at the School,” proposed exercises for different subjects using computers and encouraged collaboration between informatics courses and other subject teachers.

When I finished high school, everyone told my parents what they already knew: that I had to continue studying. However, we didn’t have enough money to send me to university, so my parents moved the entire family to a city with a public and free university. I worked teaching for one of the science fair jurors, and I put my science fair project into practice, teaching computing jointly with other courses. At that time, I met a mentor and boss at the National Institute of Agricultural Technology (INTA), where I worked as a research software engineer for 24 years. At INTA, I won two scholarships to complete my degree in computer science and my master’s degree in data mining, becoming a scientist.

Today, I teach in formal institutions like universities from different countries and communities of practice, such as R-Ladies. I also co-founded spaces like LatinR and designed and ran projects like the rOpenSci Champions Program, where people can share their knowledge and help each other improve in the open-source, software, science, and education- movements.  

*I teach because education can change lives—it changed mine.*

*I teach to give back.*

*I teach to share my power.*

**I invite you to do the same with yours.** Perhaps a child in a small town will find one of our lessons, and a door to new knowledge will open—a knowledge that empower them, that changes their life positively... and perhaps ours too.

_Thank you very much for reading._


## What to Read Instead {#sec-finale-instead}

If you are in a hurry or want a taste of what this book will cover, @Brow2018 presents ten evidence-based tips for teaching computing. You may also enjoy:

-  [The Carpentries instructor training](http://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/). A early version of this training derived the first edition of this book.

-   @Lang2016 y @Hust2012, which are short and approachable, and which connect things you can do right now to the research that backs them.

-   @Berg2012,@Lemo2014,@Majo2015,@Broo2016,@Rice2018,@Wein2018b are all full of practical suggestions for things you can do in your classroom, but may make more sense once you have a framework for understanding why their ideas work.

-   @DeBr2015, which explains what’s true about education by explaining what isn’t, and @Dida2016,  which grounds learning theory in cognitive psychology.

-   @Pape1993, which remains an inspiring vision of how computers could change education. [Amy Ko’s excellent description](https://medium.com/bits-and-behavior/mindstorms-what-did-papert-argue-and-what-does-it-mean-for-learning-and-education-c8324b58aca4) does a better job of summarizing Papert’s ideas than I possibly could, and @Craw2010 is a thought-provoking companion to both.

-   @Gree2014,@McMi2017,@Watt2014 explain why so many attempts at educational reform have failed over the past forty years, how for-profit colleges are exploiting and exacerbating the growing inequality in our society, and how technology has repeatedly failed to revolutionize education.

-   @Brow2007 y @Mann2015, because you can’t teach well without changing the system in which we teach, and you can’t do that on your own.

Those who want more academic material may also find @Guzd2015a,@Hazz2014,@Sent2018,@Finc2019,@Hpl2018, rewarding, while [Mark Guzdial’s blog](http://computinged.wordpress.com/) has consistently been informative and thought-provoking.
